## Command-Line Tools for Linguists

This course is aimed at students in the Bachelor's program in Linguists,
especially those with an interest in language technology. 
A command-line interface refers to the Shell or Terminal where users
of a computer are able to interact with computer programs by inputting lines of
text on the command-lines. In this course, we were introduced to essential skills
and tools for working in such environments. I have a Windows 11 operating system
so I operated in a Ubuntu via WSL, which provides a Unix-like system, 
but students with Mac computers were able to work directly in the Apple environtment.\\

During the weekly lessons of this course, we went over numerous ways of navigating
around the computer using command-line tools. For example, we learned how to 
work with directories, install and run programs, and create scripts for processing
linguistic corpus data. By the end of the course we as students are 
equipped with the skills and knowledge to create a GitHub-hosted webpage
that includes a home page, a link to a CV created in the Overleaf environment,
and this page that you are currently reading.

## What we learned each week

#Week 1

The first step into working in a command-line interface is setting it up. We
followed detailed instructions provided by our teachers.
